The `_Variable` context represents named variables in the Mathsys runtime with support for both mutable and immutable storage.

## Mathematical Concept
In mathematics and programming, variables are symbols that represent unknown or changeable values. Variables allow for symbolic manipulation, substitution, and the representation of relationships between quantities. In the Mathsys runtime, `_Variable` provides a mechanism for storing and retrieving values by name, supporting both mutable variables (which can be reassigned) and immutable variables (which maintain their values throughout computation). When accessing an undefined variable, the system returns `_Undefined` to maintain mathematical consistency.
