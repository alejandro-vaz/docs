## _Number
The `_Number` context represents numerical values in the Mathsys runtime with support for different scales and precisions.

## Mathematical Concept
In mathematics, numbers are fundamental entities used for counting, measuring, and labeling. The `_Number` struct in Mathsys represents numerical values using a `value` and `shift` system where the shift indicates the number of decimal places. The actual number is calculated by dividing the value by 10 raised to the power of the shift, enabling precise representation of both integers and decimal numbers without floating-point precision issues.
