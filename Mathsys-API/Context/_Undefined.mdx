The `_Undefined` context represents undefined values in the Mathsys runtime.

## Mathematical Concept
In mathematics, "undefined" refers to expressions or operations that do not have a meaningful value. This commonly occurs with operations like division by zero or other mathematical operations that cannot be resolved to a specific value. In the Mathsys runtime, `_Undefined` serves as a runtime value that represents these undefined mathematical expressions and also acts as the default value for uninitialized variables, allowing the system to handle and propagate undefined states through computations.
