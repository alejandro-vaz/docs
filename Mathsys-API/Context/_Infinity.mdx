## _Infinity
The `_Infinity` context represents the mathematical concept of infinity in the Mathsys runtime.

## Mathematical Concept
In mathematics, infinity represents a quantity that is larger than any real number. It is used in various contexts such as limits, calculus, and set theory. In the Mathsys runtime, `_Infinity` serves as a runtime value that embodies this mathematical concept, allowing for operations and computations involving infinite quantities.
