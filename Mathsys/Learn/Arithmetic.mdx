## Numbers and Basic Operations

Mathsys supports standard numeric expressions. You can write numbers directly:

```
42
3.14
-10
```

All numbers are valid expressions that evaluate to themselves.

## Addition and Subtraction

Use `+` for addition and `-` for subtraction:

```
1 + 3
# Results in 4
10 - 7
# Results in 3
1 + 2 + 3
# Results in 6 (chained operations)
```

### Grouping with Parentheses

Parentheses allow you to control the order of operations:

```
(1 + 2) + 3
# Results in 6
1 + (2 + 3)
# Results in 6 (same as above)
(10 - 3) - 2
# Results in 5
```

## Multiplication and Division

Use `*` for multiplication and `/` for division. These operations have **higher precedence** than addition and subtraction, just like in standard mathematics:

```
1 + 2 * 3
# Results in 7 (not 9!)
# Equivalent to: 1 + (2 * 3)

10 - 6 / 2
# Results in 7
# Equivalent to: 10 - (6 / 2)
```

### Explicit Grouping

Use parentheses when you want to override the default precedence:

```
(1 + 2) * 3
# Results in 9
# Explicitly: (1 + 2) first, then multiply by 3

(10 - 6) / 2
# Results in 2
# Explicitly: (10 - 6) first, then divide by 2
```

### Left-to-Right Evaluation

Multiplication and division have equal precedence and are evaluated from left to right:

```
8 / 2 * 4
# Results in 16
# Equivalent to: (8 / 2) * 4 = 4 * 4 = 16

12 / 3 / 2
# Results in 2
# Equivalent to: (12 / 3) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2
```

## Implicit Multiplication

Mathsys supports **implicit multiplication** using spaces instead of explicit `*` operators. While this may look unusual with numbers, it becomes much more natural when working with variables (like `2x` instead of `2 * x`). This syntax allows you to write mathematical expressions in a more familiar way.

### Basic Implicit Multiplication

```
1 2
# Equivalent to 1 * 2
3 4 5
# Equivalent to 3 * 4 * 5
```

### Implicit Multiplication with Division

When mixing implicit multiplication with division, the space-inherited elements follow the same numerator/denominator position as their leading element:

```
1 2 / 3
# Equivalent to (1 * 2) / 3 = 2/3
# The '2' inherits numerator position from '1'

1 / 2 3
# Equivalent to 1 / (2 * 3) = 1/6  
# The '3' inherits denominator position from '2'

1 2 / 3 4
# Equivalent to (1 * 2) / (3 * 4) = 2/12
```

### Complex Examples

```
2 3 + 4 5
# Equivalent to (2 * 3) + (4 * 5) = 6 + 20 = 26

10 / 2 3
# Equivalent to 10 / (2 * 3) = 10/6

(1 + 2) 3
# Equivalent to (1 + 2) * 3 = 9
```

## Summary

Mathsys follows standard mathematical conventions:
- **Precedence**: Multiplication/division before addition/subtraction
- **Associativity**: Left-to-right for operations of equal precedence  
- **Implicit multiplication**: Spaces create multiplication relationships
- **Parentheses**: Override default precedence and grouping
