## Numbers and Basic Operations

Mathsys supports standard numeric expressions. You can write numbers directly:

<CodeGroup dropdown>
    ```mathsys BareNodes.msd
    42
    3.14
    -10
    ```
    ```tex BareNodes.ltx
    42\\ 3.14\\ -10
    ```
</CodeGroup>

All numbers are valid expressions that evaluate to themselves.

## Addition and Subtraction

Use `+` for addition and `-` for subtraction:

<CodeGroup dropdown>
    ```mathsys SumAndSub.msd
    1 + 3
    # Results in 4
    10 - 7
    # Results in 3
    1 + 2 + 3
    # Results in 6 (chained operations)
    ```
    ```tex SumAndSub.ltx
    1+3\\ \\\text{Results in 4}\\ 10-7\\ \\\text{Results in 3}\\ 1+2+3\\ \\\text{Results in 6 (chained operations)}
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Grouping with Parentheses

Parentheses allow you to control the order of operations:

<CodeGroup dropdown>
    ```mathsys Parentheses.msd
    (1 + 2) + 3
    # Results in 6
    1 + (2 + 3)
    # Results in 6 (same as above)
    (10 - 3) - 2
    # Results in 5
    ```
    ```tex Parentheses.ltx
    \left( 1+2\right) +3\\ \\\text{Results in 6}\\ 1+\left( 2+3\right) \\ \\\text{Results in 6 (same as above)}\\ \left( 10-3\right) -2\\ \\\text{Results in 5}
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## Multiplication and Division

Use `*` for multiplication and `/` for division. These operations have **higher precedence** than addition and subtraction, just like in standard mathematics:

<CodeGroup dropdown>
    ```mathsys MultiplicationAndDivision.msd
    1 + 2 * 3
    # Results in 7 (not 9!)
    # Equivalent to: 1 + (2 * 3)
    
    10 - 6 / 2
    # Results in 7
    # Equivalent to: 10 - (6 / 2)
    ```
    ```tex MultiplicationAndDivision.ltx
    1+2\cdot 3\\ \\\text{Results in 7 (not 9!)}\\ \\\text{Equivalent to: 1 + (2 * 3)}\\ 10-\frac{6}{2}\\ \\\text{Results in 7}\\ \\\text{Equivalent to: 10 - (6 / 2)}
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Explicit Grouping

Use parentheses when you want to override the default precedence:

<CodeGroup dropdown>
    ```mathsys Grouping.msd
    (1 + 2) * 3
    # Results in 9
    # Explicitly: (1 + 2) first, then multiply by 3
    
    (10 - 6) / 2
    # Results in 2
    # Explicitly: (10 - 6) first, then divide by 2
    ```
    ```tex Grouping.ltx
    \left( 1+2\right) \cdot 3\\ \\\text{Results in 9}\\ \\\text{Explicitly: (1 + 2) first, then multiply by 3}\\ \frac{\left( 10-6\right) }{2}\\ \\\text{Results in 2}\\ \\\text{Explicitly: (10 - 6) first, then divide by 2}
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Left-to-Right Evaluation

Multiplication and division have equal precedence and are evaluated from left to right:

<CodeGroup dropdown>
    ```mathsys Precedence.msd
    8 / 2 * 4
    # Results in 16
    # Equivalent to: (8 / 2) * 4 = 4 * 4 = 16

    12 / 3 / 2
    # Results in 2
    # Equivalent to: (12 / 3) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2
    ```
    ```tex Precedence.ltx
    \frac{8\cdot 4}{2}\\ \\\text{Results in 16}\\ \\\text{Equivalent to: (8 / 2) * 4 = 4 * 4 = 16}\\ \frac{12}{3\cdot 2}\\ \\\text{Results in 2}\\ \\\text{Equivalent to: (12 / 3) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2}
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## Implicit Multiplication

Mathsys supports **implicit multiplication** using spaces instead of explicit `*` operators. While this may look unusual with numbers, it becomes much more natural when working with variables (like `2x` instead of `2 * x`). This syntax allows you to write mathematical expressions in a more familiar way.

### Basic Implicit Multiplication

<CodeGroup dropdown>
    ```mathsys ImplicitMultiplication.msd
    1 2
    # Equivalent to 1 * 2
    3 4 5
    # Equivalent to 3 * 4 * 5
    2x
    # Equivalent to 2 * x
    ```
    ```tex ImplicitMultiplication.ltx
    1\cdot 2\\ \\\text{Equivalent to 1 * 2}\\ 3\cdot 4\cdot 5\\ \\\text{Equivalent to 3 * 4 * 5}\\ 2x\\ \\\text{Equivalent to 2 * x}
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Implicit Multiplication with Division

When mixing implicit multiplication with division, the space-inherited elements follow the same numerator/denominator position as their leading element:

<CodeGroup dropdown>
    ```mathsys Inheritance.msd
    1 2 / 3
    # Equivalent to (1 * 2) / 3 = 2/3
    # The '2' inherits numerator position from '1'

    1 / 2 3
    # Equivalent to 1 / (2 * 3) = 1/6  
    # The '3' inherits denominator position from '2'

    1 2 / 4var
    # Equivalent to (1 * 2) / (4 * var)
    # 'var' inherits denominator position from '4'
    ```
    ```tex Inheritance.ltx
    \frac{1\cdot 2}{3}\\ \\\text{Equivalent to (1 * 2) / 3 = 2/3}\\ \\\text{The '2' inherits numerator position from '1'}\\ \frac{1}{2\cdot 3}\\ \\\text{Equivalent to 1 / (2 * 3) = 1/6}\\ \\\text{The '3' inherits denominator position from '2'}\\ \frac{1\cdot 2}{4var}\\ \\\text{Equivalent to (1 * 2) / (4 * var)}\\ \\\text{'var' inherits denominator position from '4'}
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## Summary

Mathsys follows standard mathematical conventions:
- **Precedence**: Multiplication/division before addition/subtraction
- **Associativity**: Left-to-right for operations of equal precedence  
- **Implicit multiplication**: Spaces create multiplication relationships
- **Parentheses**: Override default precedence and grouping
