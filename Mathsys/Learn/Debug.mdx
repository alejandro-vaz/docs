## Debug Keyword

Mathsys provides a `debug` keyword for debugging purposes:

```
#debug
```

## Syntax Rules

The debug keyword must be written exactly as `#debug` with **no spaces** between the `#` and `d`:

```
#debug
# Valid - no spaces between # and d

# debug
# Invalid - space makes this a comment, not a debug statement
```

## Current Functionality

Currently, the `debug` keyword does nothing. It's a reserved keyword for future debugging features.

```
#debug
x = 5
y = 10
# The debug statement above has no effect
```

## Usage

While the debug keyword currently has no functionality, it's reserved for future debugging capabilities in Mathsys:

```
#debug
# This line is reserved for debugging features
result = x + y
```

The debug keyword provides a foundation for future debugging tools and features that may be added to Mathsys.
