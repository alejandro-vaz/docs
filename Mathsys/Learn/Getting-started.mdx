## What is Mathsys?

**Mathsys** is a hybrid language that combines the clarity of mathematical notation with the power of computation. While LaTeX excels at typesetting mathematics, it cannot be reliably parsed or executed. Mathsys bridges this gap by providing a language that outputs beautiful LaTeX typesetting while remaining fully runnable and computable.

## Try Mathsys Online

The easiest way to get started with Mathsys is through our live playground:

**[Visit the Mathsys Playground →](https://app.abscissa.eu/playground)**

This interactive environment lets you write and run Mathsys code directly in your browser without any installation.

### Local Installation

For local development, see the installation instructions in the [Mathsys repository README](https://github.com/alejandro-vaz/mathsys).

## Syntax

### Basic Arithmetic

Mathsys supports standard arithmetic operations:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Mathsys">
        ```
        1 + 2
        # Results in 3

        10 - 3
        # Results in 7

        4 * 5
        # Results in 20

        15 / 3
        # Results in 5
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Output">
        $$1+2\\ \\\text{Results in 3}\\ 10-3\\ \\\text{Results in 7}\\ 4\cdot 5\\ \\\text{Results in 20}\\ \frac{15}{3}\\ \\\text{Results in 5}$$
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="LaTeX">
        ```tex
        1+2\\ \\\text{Results in 3}\\ 10-3\\ \\\text{Results in 7}\\ 4\cdot 5\\ \\\text{Results in 20}\\ \frac{15}{3}\\ \\\text{Results in 5}
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Variables

You can assign values to variables using `=`:

```
x = 5
y = 3
x + y
# Results in 8
```

Variables can be used in expressions just like numbers:

```
a = 2
b = 3
a * b + 1
# Results in 7
```

## LaTeX Output

All Mathsys code is directly transpilable to LaTeX, producing beautiful mathematical typesetting:

```
2x^2^ + 3x + 1
```

Transpiles to:

$$2x^{2}+3x+1$$

```tex
\(2x^{2}+3x+1\)
```

## Why Mathsys?

Traditional programming languages require you to translate mathematical concepts into their syntax. Mathsys lets you write mathematics naturally:

**Traditional programming:**
```python
result = 2 * x**2 + 3 * x + 1
```

**Mathsys:**
```
2x^2^ + 3x + 1
```

This makes Mathsys perfect for:
- Mathematical modeling
- Scientific computing
- Educational purposes
- Prototyping mathematical algorithms
