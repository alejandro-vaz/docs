## Multicharacter Variables

Unlike traditional mathematical notation, Mathsys supports **multicharacter variable names**. This design choice makes mathematical expressions more descriptive and readable, especially when working with complex formulas.

Instead of using single letters like `m`, you can use descriptive names like `mass`:

```
mass = 10
velocity = 5
kineticEnergy = 0.5 * mass * velocity^2^
```

### Variable Naming Rules

Variable names in Mathsys must follow the pattern `[a-zA-Z]+`, meaning:
- **Only letters** (no numbers, underscores, or special characters)
- **Use camelCase or PascalCase** for multi-word variables
- **No underscores allowed**

```
# Valid variable names
mass = 10
velocity = 5
kineticEnergy = 0.5 * mass * velocity^2^
totalForce = mass * acceleration
MaxValue = 100

# Invalid variable names
kinetic_energy = 10  # Error: underscores not allowed
velocity2 = 5        # Error: numbers not allowed
total-force = 10     # Error: hyphens not allowed
```

This approach is particularly powerful in computational mathematics where clarity and maintainability are crucial.

## Greek Variables

Mathsys supports Greek variable names that are automatically transpiled to proper Greek letters in LaTeX output:

```
alpha = 0.5
beta = 1.2
gamma = 2.0
theta = pi / 4
```

When transpiled to LaTeX, these variables become:

$$\alpha =0.5\\ \beta =1.2\\ \gamma =2.0\\ \theta =\frac{\pi }{4}$$

This makes mathematical expressions look natural and professional, just like traditional mathematical notation.

## Variable Assignment

Mathsys provides two distinct ways to assign values to variables:

### Declaration (`=`)

The **declaration** operator creates or modifies a **mutable** variable:

```
x = 3
x = 5
# x is now 5
```

Mutable variables can be reassigned multiple times throughout your code.

### Definition (`==`)

The **definition** operator creates an **immutable** variable:

```
x == 3
# x is now permanently 3
```

Once defined with `==`, a variable cannot be reassigned:

```
x == 3
x == 2
# Error: cannot reassign immutable variable

x == 3
x = 2
# Error: cannot reassign immutable variable
```

## Converting Mutable to Immutable

You can convert a mutable variable to an immutable one:

```
x = 2
x == 3
# x is now immutable with value 3
```

You can even make a variable immutable while keeping its current value:

```
x = 2
x == x
# x is now immutable with value 2
```
