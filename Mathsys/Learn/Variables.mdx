## Multicharacter Variables

Unlike traditional mathematical notation, Mathsys supports **multicharacter variable names**. This design choice makes mathematical expressions more descriptive and readable, especially when working with complex formulas.

Instead of using single letters like `m`, you can use descriptive names like `mass`:

```
mass = 10
velocity = 5
kineticEnergy = 0.5 * mass * velocity^2^
```

### Variable Naming Rules

Variable names in Mathsys must follow the pattern `[a-zA-Z]+`, meaning:
- **Only letters** (no numbers, underscores, or special characters)
- **Use camelCase or PascalCase** for multi-word variables
- **No underscores allowed**

```
# Valid variable names
mass = 10
velocity = 5
kineticEnergy = 0.5 * mass * velocity^2^
totalForce = mass * acceleration
MaxValue = 100

# Invalid variable names
kinetic_energy = 10  # Error: underscores not allowed
velocity2 = 5        # Error: numbers not allowed
total-force = 10     # Error: hyphens not allowed
```

This approach is particularly powerful in computational mathematics where clarity and maintainability are crucial.

## Greek Variables

Mathsys supports Greek variable names that are automatically transpiled to proper Greek letters in LaTeX output:

```
alpha = 0.5
beta = 1.2
gamma = 2.0
theta = pi / 4
```

When transpiled to LaTeX, these variables become:

$$\alpha =0.5\\ \beta =1.2\\ \gamma =2.0\\ \theta =\frac{\pi }{4}$$

This makes mathematical expressions look natural and professional, just like traditional mathematical notation.

## Variable Assignment

Mathsys provides two distinct ways to assign values to variables:

### Declaration (`=`)

The **declaration** operator creates or modifies a **mutable** variable:

```
x = 3
x = 5
# x is now 5
```

Mutable variables can be reassigned multiple times throughout your code.

### Definition (`==`)

The **definition** operator creates an **immutable** variable:

```
x == 3
# x is now permanently 3
```

Once defined with `==`, a variable cannot be reassigned:

```
x == 3
x == 2
# Error: cannot reassign immutable variable

x == 3
x = 2
# Error: cannot reassign immutable variable
```

## Converting Mutable to Immutable

You can convert a mutable variable to an immutable one:

```
x = 2
x == 3
# x is now immutable with value 3
```

You can even make a variable immutable while keeping its current value:

```
x = 2
x == x
# x is now immutable with value 2
```

## Practical Examples

### Descriptive Variable Names

```
# Traditional math notation
F = m * a

# Mathsys with descriptive names
force = mass * acceleration
```

### Mixed Mutable and Immutable Variables

```
# Constants (immutable)
pi == 3.14159
gravity == 9.81

# Variables (mutable)
position = 0
velocity = 10
time = 0

# Calculate new position
position = position + velocity * time
```

### Converting to Constants

```
# Start with mutable variables
initialVelocity = 10
acceleration = -2

# Convert to immutable when values are finalized
initialVelocity == initialVelocity
acceleration == acceleration

# Now they cannot be changed
```

## Benefits

- **Clarity**: Descriptive names make mathematical expressions self-documenting
- **Safety**: Immutable variables prevent accidental modifications
- ****Flexibility**: Choose between mutable and immutable based on your needs
- ****Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify complex mathematical code
