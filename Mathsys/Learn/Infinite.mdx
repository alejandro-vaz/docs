## The Infinity Keyword

Mathsys provides the `inf` keyword to represent infinity symbolically:

```
x = inf
# x is now infinity
```

## Symbolic Nature

Unlike regular numbers, `inf` doesn't have a numerical value but rather a **symbolic** one. It represents the mathematical concept of infinity:

```
value = inf
# value is symbolically infinite, not a large number
```

## Mathematical Context

The `inf` keyword allows you to work with infinity in a mathematically rigorous way, making it perfect for:

- Limit calculations
- Mathematical analysis
- Theoretical computations
- Educational purposes

Unlike representing infinity as an arbitrarily large number, `inf` maintains the symbolic nature of infinity, allowing Mathsys to handle it according to proper mathematical rules.
