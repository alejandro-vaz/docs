## Keyword

`inf` is the keyword for infinite. It just serves that purpose. 

It can be used wherever a number could be used, for example.

```ms3
x = -inf / 3
# is still -inf
```

It represents the concept of infinity. Computationally, it is not "just a very big number," it has it's own symbolic attributes.

It is especially useful for limits.
