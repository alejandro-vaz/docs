## Usage

Limits in Mathsys have the following syntax:

```ebnf
lim {var name} -> {expression}{sign?} of ({expression})
```

like this one

```ms3
e == lim n->inf of (1 + 1 / n)^n^
```

## Signed limits

Signed limits have their expression followed by a sign (either `+` or `-`):

```ms3
lim x->0+ of (1 / x)
# results in inf

lim x->0- of (1 / x)
# results in -inf

lim x->0 of (1 / x)
# results in undefined
```
