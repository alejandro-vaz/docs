## Limit Syntax

Limits in Mathsys follow the mathematical notation `lim variable->value of expression`:

```
e == lim alpha->0 of (1 + 1/alpha)^alpha^
# Euler's number as a limit
```

## Basic Structure

A limit consists of three parts:

1. **`lim`** - the limit keyword
2. **`variable->value`** - the variable and what it tends to
3. **`of (expression)`** - the expression being evaluated

## Expression Requirements

The expression in a limit **must always be enclosed in parentheses**:

```
# Valid
result == lim n->inf of (1 + 1/n)^n^

# Valid - even simple expressions need parentheses
simple == lim x->2 of (x + 1)
```

The expression may or may not include exponents:

```
# With exponentiation
e == lim alpha->0 of (1 + 1/alpha)^alpha^

# Without exponentiation
slope == lim h->0 of (((x + h)^2^ - x^2^) / h)
```

## Directional Limits

Limits can specify the direction of approach using `+` or `-`:

```
# Approaching from the right (positive direction)
value == lim x->0+ of (1 / x)
# This limit is defined to be infinity

# Approaching from the left (negative direction)
leftLimit == lim x->0- of (1 / x)
# This limit is defined to be negative infinity
```

## Common Limit Examples

```
# Fundamental limits
e == lim n->inf of (1 + 1/n)^n^
# Euler's number

# Polynomial limits
polyLimit == lim x->2 of (x^2^ + 3x - 1)
# Direct substitution: 4 + 6 - 1 = 9

# Infinity limits
infLimit == lim x->inf of (1 / x)
# Equal to 0
```
## Mathematical Applications

Limits are essential for:

- **Calculus** - derivatives and integrals
- **Analysis** - continuity and convergence
- **Series** - infinite sums and sequences
- **Asymptotic behavior** - understanding function behavior at boundaries
