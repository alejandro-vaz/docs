## Number Types

Mathsys supports two basic number types:

### Integers

Whole numbers without decimal points:

```
1
42
-10
1000
```

### Floating-Point Numbers

Numbers with decimal points:

```
3.14
2.5
-0.5
100.0
```

## Usage

Numbers can be used directly in expressions:

```
1 + 2
# Results in 3

3.14 * 2
# Results in 6.28

10 / 3
# Results in 3.333...
```

Numbers can be assigned to variables:

```
radius = 5.5
area = 3.14 * radius^2^
```
