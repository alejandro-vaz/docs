## Vector Syntax

Vectors in Mathsys are created using **square brackets** with **comma-separated** elements:

```
x = [1, 0]
# Creates a 2D vector with elements 1 and 0

y = [3, 4, 5]
# Creates a 3D vector with elements 3, 4, and 5
```

## Vector Elements

Vector elements can be any valid Mathsys expressions:

```
# Numbers
position = [10, 20, 30]

# Variables
x = 1
y = 2
z = 3
coordinates = [x, y, z]

# Expressions
velocity = [2 * 5, 3 + 1, 10 / 2]
# Results in [10, 4, 5]
```

## Empty Vectors

Vectors can have any length, including **zero elements** (empty vectors):

```
emptyVector = []
# Creates an empty vector

var == []
# Creates an immutable empty vector
```

## Variable Assignment

Like other variables, vectors can be declared (mutable) or defined (immutable):

```
# Mutable vector - can change contents and length
point = [1, 2, 3]
point = [4, 5, 6]
# point is now [4, 5, 6]

point = [7, 8]
# point is now [7, 8] (changed length from 3 to 2)

point = []
# point is now [] (changed to empty vector)

# Immutable vector
origin == [0, 0, 0]
# origin is permanently [0, 0, 0]
```

## Common Use Cases

Vectors are perfect for representing:

```
# 2D coordinates
position = [100, 200]

# 3D coordinates
location = [x, y, z]

# Mathematical vectors
velocity = [vx, vy, vz]
acceleration = [ax, ay, az]

# Data sets
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
