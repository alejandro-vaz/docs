## Usage

Multiplication in Mathsys is straightforward with the `*` operator:

```ms3
12 * 13

6 * 7
```

Division is also available with the `/` operator:

```ms3
4 / 3

2 / 9
```

You can combine them both in an expression:

```ms3
2 * 3 / 5

6 * 7 / 11

6 / 7 * 4
```

and operator precedence is respected with summation and subtraction:

```ms3
1 + 1 / 5
```

## Implicit multiplication

Multiplication is also available implicitly, without needing to write the operator each time:

```ms3
12x

6 - 4y

4 3
```

A space is not required between variables and numbers.

## Fraction carryover

Fraction carryover is the property that allows you to maintain the position on a fraction when relying on implicit multiplication. It means that whenever `*` is used, the position is reset to numerator, but if implicif multiplication is used, the position is inherited from the previous element:

```ms3
# this is three times y
3y

# this is one over (two x)
1 / 2x

# this is six over (seven times eight)
6 / 7 8

# this is one half times four
1 / 2*4
```
