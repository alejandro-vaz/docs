## Comment Syntax

Comments in Mathsys are written with the `#` symbol:

```
# This is a comment
x = 5
```

## Comment Rules

Comments must follow these rules:

1. **Must be on a new line** - comments cannot be inline with code
2. **Must start with `#`** - the hash symbol
3. **Must have a space immediately after `#`** - no space means it's not a comment

```
# Valid comment
x = 10

# Valid - multiple spaces are fine
#    This is also a valid comment
```

## Common Uses

Comments are perfect for:

```
# Explaining what variables represent
mass = 10
velocity = 5
# Calculate kinetic energy
kineticEnergy = 0.5 * mass * velocity^2^

# Documenting complex expressions
# Euler's number as a limit
e == lim n->inf of (1 + 1/n)^n^

# Marking sections of code
# Vector operations
position = [1, 2, 3]
twoPosition = 2position
```

## Best Practices

Use comments to make your Mathsys code more readable:

```
# Mathematical constants
pi == 3.14159
e == 2.71828

# Physics calculations
# Force = mass * acceleration
force = mass * acceleration

# This limit represents the derivative of x^2 at x=2
derivative == lim h->0 of (((2 + h)^2^ - 4) / h)
```

Comments help others (and yourself) understand the mathematical meaning behind your code, making complex expressions more maintainable and educational.
