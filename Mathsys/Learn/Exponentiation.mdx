## Exponentiation Syntax

Mathsys uses carets (`^`) for exponentiation, but unlike other programming languages, these carets act as **brackets** rather than operators. This design maintains mathematical conciseness and natural expression.

### Basic Exponentiation

```
x^2^
# x squared

y^3^
# y cubed

z^n^
# z to the power of n
```

### Syntax Rules

The **first caret must be written directly next to the variable** with no spaces:

```
# Valid syntax
x^2^
variable^3^
mass^2^

# Invalid syntax
x ^2^     # Error: space before first caret
variable ^3^   # Error: space before first caret
```

### Natural Mathematical Expression

This bracket-style notation allows for natural mathematical expressions without requiring parentheses:

```
x^y + 1^
# Equivalent to x^(y+1)

2x^2 + 3x + 1^
# Equivalent to 2x^(2+3x+1)
```

### Complex Examples

```
# Variables in exponents
base^exponent^
# base raised to the power of exponent

# Multiple operations
x^y + z^
# x^(y+z)

# With Greek variables
alpha^beta + gamma^
# alpha^(beta+gamma)
```

### LaTeX Output

When transpiled to LaTeX, exponentiation expressions produce proper mathematical notation:

```
x^2^
```

Transpiles to:

$$x^{2}$$

```tex
\(x^{2}\)
```

```
x^y + 1^
```

Transpiles to:

$$x^{y+1}$$

```tex
\(x^{y+1}\)
```
