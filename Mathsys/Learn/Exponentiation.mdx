## Brackets

In Mathsys, you don't need to use brackets to use exponentiation. This is because the carets (`^`) act as brackets in Mathsys code themselves, and need to be closed off.

Here's a brief example

```ms3
2^3^
# this is two to the third power
```

This double-caret syntax allows to parse complex expressions inside the delimiters' space without needing extra parentheses:

```ms3
2^4 - 1^
```

note that the first caret must not be preceded by an space.

## Examples

```ms3
x^2^

y^3^

m^1 / 2^

z^y^x^^

n^3*7^
```
